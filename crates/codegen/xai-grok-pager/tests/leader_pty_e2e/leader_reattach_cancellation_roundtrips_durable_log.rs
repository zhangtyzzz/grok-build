/// 25. **Leader reattach — cancellation round-trips through the durable log.**
/// A turn driven on leader client A is Ctrl+C-cancelled mid-stream; the leader
/// must persist a `turn_completed` terminal with `stop_reason == cancelled`
/// (the producer fail-before). A FRESH client must replay the cancelled
/// transcript through the same leader and land clean — running, no panic, and
/// not stranded on the "Waiting"/"Cancelling" spinners — and must still hold
/// that transcript after A (the original driver) exits. A keep-alive viewer
/// holds the leader up across A's exit (the leader stops with its last client).
///
/// C attaches *before* A is dropped: `PtyHarness` Drop SIGKILLs the child, and
/// under full-suite contention a cold `--resume` handshake racing that teardown
/// flakes with an empty screen for the whole `LEADER_TIMEOUT` (the observed
/// "C replayed the cancelled transcript" timeout). Replaying while A is still
/// up, then proving C survives A's exit, covers the durable-log + multi-client
/// survival invariants without that race.
