// ── A7: wheel overscroll at the bottom re-engages follow mode ─────────────
//
// User complaint: after wheeling up to read during a streaming turn, wheeling
// back down to the bottom left a "dead wheel tick" before follow mode
// resumed. `scroll_down` now re-engages follow on the first FULLY-CLAMPED
// wheel-down at the bottom (zero rows moved), while a scroll that merely
// lands there (real rows moved) still never engages.
//
// This test drives the whole loop end-to-end mid-stream: wheel up (follow
// exits, viewport parks while deltas keep arriving), wheel back down past
// the bottom (the overscroll), then assert the viewport FOLLOWS the still
// streaming tail — the final chunk becomes visible with no further input.
// With follow left disengaged, new rows accumulate below the parked
// viewport and the sentinel never enters the screen.
//
// Honest scope note: the down burst deliberately over-travels, so it
// contains many clamped events — a PTY cannot pin "exactly one clamped tick
// engages" (any wheel journey back to the bottom lands before it clamps, and
// the pre-fix flag-arming path also engaged within such a burst). The
// single-event semantics are pinned by the `scrollback::state::nav` unit
// tests; this test pins the user-visible contract on the real binary.
// Non-vacuous by negative control: with the engage branch compiled out,
// this test fails (STREAMDONE never becomes visible).
//
// Determinism: `TERM_PROGRAM=zed` + `GROK_SCROLL_MODE=wheel` +
// `GROK_SCROLL_LINES=1` price every SGR report at exactly one row with no
// classification variance (see `forced_wheel_mode_env_scrolls_exact_rows`),
// and the completion gate holds the turn's terminal SSE event so every
// assertion below is provably mid-turn.

/// transcript top, and markers stay visible above the streamed tail.
