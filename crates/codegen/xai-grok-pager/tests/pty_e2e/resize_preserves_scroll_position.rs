// ── Reproduction: horizontal resize must not lose the scroll position ─────
//
// Bug: when the user has scrolled UP into grok's scrollback (NOT pinned to the
// bottom / not following) and the terminal is resized HORIZONTALLY, grok loses
// its scroll position and the view jumps. Root cause:
// `ScrollbackState.scroll_offset` is an ABSOLUTE count of WRAPPED DISPLAY ROWS
// (`scrollback/state/mod.rs`). On a width change `prepare_layout` re-wraps all
// content at the new width and rebuilds the row map, but LEAVES `scroll_offset`
// unchanged (Case 1 full rebuild) — so the same row number now points at
// different content and the viewport jumps. It only happens when NOT following;
// in follow/tail mode grok re-pins to the bottom (no jump).
//
// This test parks the marker in the MIDDLE of the viewport while scrolled into
// the middle of the transcript (TOP and BOTTOM sentinels both scrolled off),
// then resizes the WIDTH only. With the bug present the marker JUMPS several
// rows (re-wrapping the content above it changes its display height, but the
// stale `scroll_offset` keeps pointing at the old row number); the fix
// (`ScrollbackState`'s logical-line scroll anchor, captured before the width
// rebuild and restored after) re-pins the viewport-top content across the
// reflow so the marker stays put.
//
// Runs FULLSCREEN (alt-screen): grok's mode-independent scroll-anchor logic is
// what's under test. `Viewport::Fullscreen` is autoresized on resize with no DSR
// cursor probe, so grok itself re-wraps at the new width, and the alt-screen grid
// is not reflowed by the terminal — so the marker's position reflects grok's own
// re-layout, with no harness-reflow confound.
