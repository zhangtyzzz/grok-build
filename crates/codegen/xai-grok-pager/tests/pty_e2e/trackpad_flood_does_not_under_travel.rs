// ── Regression: trackpad feel — fast flicks must not under-travel ─────────
//
// User complaint: fast trackpad flicks felt "laggy AND too sensitive" and
// under-traveled. The trackpad flush path had a fixed 6-line per-flush cap:
// at the 16ms cadence that is a hard ~360 lines/s delivery ceiling no matter
// how fast the gesture or how tall the viewport, and whatever backlog was
// still queued when the stream finalized was discarded beyond one more
// 6-line flush — the flick's tail simply evaporated. The fix makes the cap
// proportional (half the viewport per flush, floored at 6) so delivery
// scales with gesture demand, and the finalize flush drains the whole-line
// backlog up to that cap.
//
// The trackpad cap only binds once a stream is CONFIRMED trackpad, which
// happens mid-stream only on ept=1 brands (their rapid same-direction runs
// promote at the 3rd event; the harness default `TerminalName::Unknown` is
// ept=3, where auto streams stay Unknown until finalize and flush uncapped).
// So this test presents `TERM_PROGRAM=iTerm.app` (ept=1) and floods wheel-up
// reports with `GROK_SCROLL_SPEED=100` (6x multiplier — an existing user
// setting, used here as a deterministic demand amplifier). Total viewport
// travel is then classification- and jitter-robust:
//
// - Every event contributes at least 1 base line even at the 1.0x accel
//   floor, so desired travel is ≥ 40 × 1 × 6 = 240 rows no matter how much
//   scheduler jitter stretches the 6ms gaps (jitter only lowers the accel
//   multiplier toward 1.0; the speed multiplier is timing-independent). The
//   proportional cap (~20 lines/flush at the 50-row PTY) drains that demand
//   within the burst plus the 80ms stream-gap window, so travel stays above
//   TRAVEL_FLOOR. If extreme stretching (avg gap > 30ms) prevents trackpad
//   promotion entirely, the stream is wheel-like and uncapped: travel = 240.
// - Under the parent's fixed 6-line cap the same flood delivers at most 6
//   lines per 16ms slot: a ~260ms burst spans ~16 slots (~96 rows), plus the
//   post-stop gap window (5 slots + one finalize flush ≈ 36 rows) — ≈ 130
//   rows total, with the remaining backlog discarded at finalize. Verified
//   against a parent-built binary: travel came out 138 rows (< TRAVEL_FLOOR).
//
// One jitter regime the floor does NOT cover is arrival COMPRESSION (the
// mirror of stretching, per the driver contract in `scroll.rs`): if the
// pager is descheduled for the whole host-paced burst, all reports queue in
// the PTY and arrive as one batch. Accel maxes but delivery is cap-bound to
// one in-batch flush plus the post-stop gap window (~5 cadence slots + one
// finalize flush ≈ 7 flushes × ~20 lines ≈ 140 rows) — a legitimate
// cap-bound outcome numerically indistinguishable from the parent defect
// (138). The regimes separate by CAUSE, visible in the frame count: a
// compressed burst paints ≲7 frames, while the parent's 6-line cap needs
// ~16+ flush frames to travel that far. The detector below softens the
// floor assertion in the compressed regime (distinct message) so a CI stall
// is not misread as the regression; the floor stays a hard assertion in the
// normal regime.
//
// Only byte-deterministic quantities are asserted (marker indices on the
// final screen, frame counts from the preamble's reset_timing() capture) —
// the post-burst update() is a drain window, not a timing assertion.
// Per-flush pacing/cap math is pinned by the synthetic-clock unit tests in
// `src/input/mouse.rs`.
