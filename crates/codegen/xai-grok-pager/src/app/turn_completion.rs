//! Finalizing a turn from a terminal turn signal.
//!
//! The pager learns a turn reached its terminal outcome from two rails: the
//! fire-and-forget `x.ai/session/prompt_complete` broadcast (the one-release
//! compat path for not-yet-upgraded leaders) and the durable, persisted+replayed
//! `XaiSessionUpdate::TurnCompleted`. Both converge on
//! [`finalize_turn_from_terminal`] so the turn-finalize behavior lives in one
//! place — and so a viewer that re-attaches mid-turn can finalize the turn from
//! replay instead of staying stuck on "Waiting…".
